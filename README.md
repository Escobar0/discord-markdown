# Discord Text Formatting

### Hello there, welcome to my discord text formatting guide!

---

### To create bolded text in discord, all you have to do is start and end the bolded text with two asterisks (*).

```
Here’s an example of **bolded text**
```

### To create italics or italicized text in Discord, you have to type the asterisk once again, but this time use only one asterisk.

```
Here’s an example of *italicized text*
```

### You might’ve been able to guess the markdown for Bold + Italics by now.

```
Here’s an example of ***bold italicized text***
```

### To format our text as underlined, we need two use two underscores (__)

```
Here’s an example of __underlined text__
```

### For strikethrough text, we need to use the tilde (~) key.

```
Here’s an example of ~~crossed out~~ text
```

### We can also combine the underline into bold, italics, and bold+italics.

```
__*underlined and italicized text*__
```

### To create a single line code block in discord, you need to use the ‘tick’ or ‘backtick’ character: `.

```
`This is an example of a single line code block`
```

### Just like the single line code block, multi-line code blocks also use the backtick character. The only difference is, instead of writing a single backtick you have to write three before and after your text.

```
```This is
a great example
for people that don't know how use codeblocks```
```

### The syntax to use Block Quotes is > or >>> followed by a space.

```
