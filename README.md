### Hello there, welcome to my discord markdown guide!

Markdown is created in 2004 by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz, [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a markup language designed to be lightweight and simple to read/write. It’s completely text-based and uses cleverly placed symbols to format words in bold, italics, underlined, etc.

We’re going to dig into Discord Markdown in the next section so you can learn how to properly format all of your messages in any way you’d like.

### To create bolded text in discord, all you have to do is start and end the bolded text with two asterisks (*).

```
Here’s an example of **bolded text**
```

### To create italics or italicized text in Discord, you have to type the asterisk once again, but this time use only one asterisk.

```
Here’s an example of *italicized text*
```

### You might’ve been able to guess the markdown for Bold + Italics by now.

```
Here’s an example of ***bold italicized text***
```

### To format our text as underlined, we need two use two underscores (__)

```
Here’s an example of __underlined text__
```

### For strikethrough text, we need to use the tilde (~) key.

```
Here’s an example of ~~crossed out~~ text
```

### We can also combine the underline into bold, italics, and bold+italics.

```
__*underlined and italicized text*__
```

### To create a single line code block in discord, you need to use the ‘tick’ or ‘backtick’ character: `.

```
`This is an example of a single line code block`
```

### Just like the single line code block, multi-line code blocks also use the backtick character. The only difference is, instead of writing a single backtick you have to write three before and after your text.

```
```This is
a great example
for people that don't know how use codeblocks```
```

### The syntax to use Block Quotes is > or >>> followed by a space.

```
